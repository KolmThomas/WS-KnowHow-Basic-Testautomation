// ðŸ“˜ 01_variables.ts
// In this file, you will learn what a variable is and how to use it.
// Quick Info: Everyhing after the '//' is a comment and does not affect the code.
// A variable is like a box where you store information.
// You give the box a name, tell what kind of thing goes inside (the type), and then put something in it (the value).
// Example:
// 'firstName' is the name of the variable.
// 'string' means it stores text.
// '"Anna"' is the value we put inside.
var firstName = "Anna";
// This line prints the value of the variable to the terminal.
// 'console.log' means: "Show this on the screen".
console.log("First name:", firstName);
// Another example with a number:
var age = 30;
console.log("Age:", age);
// And one with a true/false value:
var isTester = true;
console.log("Is a tester?", isTester);
// You can also change the value later:
firstName = "Ben";
console.log("New first name:", firstName);
// Continue now with 02_loops.ts to learn about loops and conditions.
