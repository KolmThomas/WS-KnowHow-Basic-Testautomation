// ðŸ§ª What is "test"?
// "test" is a function that defines a test case.
// We give it a name ("Open example.com in browser") and then write what the test should do.

test('Open example.com in browser', async ({ page }) => {
  // "page" is like a browser tab. We use it to interact with the website.

  // ðŸ‘‰ Open the webpage
  await page.goto('https://example.com');

  // âœ… Check that the page has the correct title
  // "expect" is used to check if something is true.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example Domain/);
